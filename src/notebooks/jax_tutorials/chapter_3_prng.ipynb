    "## What is PRNG?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we go by the definition, then **`Pseudo Random Number Generation`** is a process of generating a sequence of random numbers **algorithmically** such that the properties of the generated random numbers approximate the properties of a sequence of random numbers sampled from an appropriate distribution. And when we say `random`, it means that the probability of predicting this sequence is no better than a random guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we are concerned about the randomness here, pseudo random number generation isn't *truly* a random process. Why? Because the sequence is determined by the initial value or initial state provided to the algorithm. The **algorithm** used to generate these sequences of random numbers is known as **`Pseudo Random Number Generator`**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is PRNG used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "PRNG has a lot of use cases but among the most interesting ones are in `Cryptography`, `Simulations`, `Games`, `Data Science and Machine Learning`(of course), etc. You might have noticed that *most* people set the **`seed`** in their Data Science and Machine Learning workflow. The **seed** is known as the initial value!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why should you care about PRNG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are tons of use cases of PRNG, I would keep this very specific to Data Science and Machine Learning workflow. When we set a seed, what we try to solve is the `reproducibility` issue. Although `reproducibility` depends on a lot of things, I will use the term very loosely in this context. \n",
    "\n",
    "We deal with random states in Machine Learning work more often than we think about. For example, splitting a dataset into training and validation sets, sampling the weights of a hidden layer from a given distribution in a neural network, sampling a noise vector from a Gaussian distribution, etc. So, when we say `reproducible` in this context, what we mean is that no matter how many times I run the same process, I should get the same sequence of random numbers. That's why setting a seed becomes important. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Saying it again, setting `seed` doesn't solve the reproducibility crisis of a workflow, it's just a first step to ensure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example to clear the point about reproducibility!"

    "3. **Sequential Equivalent Guarantee**: One of the good things about random number generation in `numpy` is that it ensures sequential equivalent guarantee. What does that mean? It means that whether you sample a vector of `n` elements at once, or sample `n` elements but one at a time, the final sequence will always be the same. Let's see this one in action"

    "1. Global state is bad for reproducibility: Global state is problematic especially if you are going to implement some sort of concurrency in your code. That's why the original way to set global seed in numpy isn't encouraged anymore\n",
    "2. With a shared global state, it’s hard to reason about how it’s being used and updated across different threads, processes, and devices, and it’s very easy to screw up when the details of entropy production and consumption are hidden from the end-user.\n",
    "3. The **Mersenne Twister PRNG** used in most of the python and numpy code has several [initialization issues](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1276927.1276928)\n",

    "# JAX PRNG: Pros and Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen the design of PRNG in JAX and how it is implemented and consumed, it is time to discuss the `pros` and `cons` of this approach. **After all, anything and everything has pros and cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The JAX PRNG is a counter-based PRNG design and it uses the **Threefry hash function**. This design allows JAX to escape sequential execution order constraint, allowing everything to be vectorizable and to be parallelizable without giving up on reproducibility\n",
    "2. Every random function consumes the state but doesn't change it. Neither the `key` has to be returned from the function\n",
    "3. The `split` method is **deterministic**. So, if you start with a random key, and split it into `n` keys in your code, you can be assured that every time you run the code, you will get the same splits. We will see an example of this right away\n",
    "4. You can generate `n` number of keys from a key in a single go and keep passing them around"
